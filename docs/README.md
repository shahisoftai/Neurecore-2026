## 💡 Pro Tips

1. **Don't Read Everything at Once**
   - Start with ROADMAP_SUMMARY.md
   - Then read your role-specific documents
   - Reference others as needed

2. **Use This as Team Training**
   - Week 1: Everyone reads ROADMAP_SUMMARY.md
   - Week 2: Engineers read their role docs
   - Weekly: Reference relevant sections in standups

3. **Print or Share**
   - Each document is self-contained
   - Can be shared individually
   - Can be printed or converted to PDF

4. **Keep Updated**
   - Update documents as you progress
   - Keep timeline current
   - Document decisions & changes

5. **Use for Retrospectives**
   - Did Phase 1 take longer than 6 weeks? Document why
   - Did we follow the architecture? Document deviations
   - What would we change? Update roadmap
