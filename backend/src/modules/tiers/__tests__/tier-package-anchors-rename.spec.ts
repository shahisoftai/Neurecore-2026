/**
 * Phase 9 N6 — Part 9 of 11 audit items.
 *
 * Locks in the rename of `Tier.packages` → `Tier.packageAnchors`
 * (per TIER-SYSTEM-CONCEPT.md §6.1). The rename is a Prisma-client-only
 * change — no SQL DDL required because the underlying FK column
 * (`packages.tierId`) is on the Package side, not the Tier side.
 *
 * See:
 *   - backend/prisma/schema.prisma (Tier.packageAnchors relation)
 *   - backend/prisma/migrations/20260723_tier_package_anchors_rename/
 *   - memory-bank-new/industries/TIER-SYSTEM-CONCEPT.md §6.1
 *
 * Test strategy: this file is a compile-time regression guard. The
 * assignments below reference `packageAnchors` (not `packages`); if
 * the schema reverts, TypeScript will fail to compile these tests
 * because the relation field would no longer exist on the `Tier`
 * generated type. We also add a runtime assertion so the intent is
 * visible in test output.
