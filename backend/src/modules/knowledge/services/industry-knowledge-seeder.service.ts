/**
 * IndustryKnowledgeSeeder — seeds tenant-scoped knowledge corpus rows
 * keyed by industry group. Phase 7 G1.
 *
 * INDUSTRY-SETUP-CONCEPT.md §3.6 / IMPLEMENTATION-PLAN Phase 7.
 *
 * KnowledgeEntry rows are tenant-scoped (per the schema's tenantId FK),
 * so the industry corpus must be cloned to each tenant at onboarding
 * time. This service centralises that cloning logic so the
 * TenantTemplateSeederService can call it without duplicating content.
 *
 * SRP: this service only knows about seeding industry knowledge corpus.
 *      It does NOT handle runtime RAG retrieval (that's RAGPipeline /
 *      VectorStoreService).
 * DRY: industry content lives in `INDUSTRY_KNOWLEDGE_CORPUS` below
 *      (the single source of truth) — adding a new industry group means
 *      adding one entry there.
 *
 * PGVector note: this seeder writes `contentVector = null` because
 * embeddings require an OpenAI API key at seed time. The RAG pipeline
 * falls back to BM25 keyword search when contentVector is NULL (see
 * VectorStoreService.search — it filters rows with NULL contentVector).
 * Production tenants run a one-shot backfill script that calls
 * `seedAllEmbeddings()` after this seeder completes.
