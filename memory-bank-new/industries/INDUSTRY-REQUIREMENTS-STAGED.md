### 1.3 Common Feature Add-ons Principle

When a feature needs minor industry additions:
- **Add-on, not override:** Create an `_addon` component alongside the common feature
- **Example:** Finance workflow has approval routing. We create `ApprovalRouting.tsx` (common) + `ApprovalRouting_FinancialAddon.tsx` (financial-specific) that references the same underlying approval logic but adds "Supervisor → CFO → Audit Committee" escalation path for financial reviews.

*(Remaining industry deep dives follow the same structure as Healthcare. For brevity, I'll provide the executive summary for other groups.)*

### 6.2 Public & Social — Executive Summary

**Three sub-groups with shared Stage 1, diverging Stage 2-3:**

| Phase | Government | Education | Non-Profit |
|-------|-----------|-----------|-----------|
| **Stage 1** | Case mgmt, budget tracking, FOIA prep | Student progress, grant mgmt, research tracking | Volunteer hours, donor tracking, grant lifecycle |
| **Stage 2** | Regulatory automation, caseload forecasting, constituent portal | Student success prediction, alumni engagement, accreditation automation | Impact modeling, donor LTV, program evaluation |
| **Stage 3** | Multi-agency consolidation, demand sensing, constituent analytics | Research impact scoring, funding ROI, career tracking | Peer benchmarking, evidence-based programming, ecosystem partnership |

---

### 6.3 Financial & Compliance — Executive Summary

**Two sub-groups with shared fundamentals, diverging specializations:**

| Phase | Financial Services | Accounting & Audit |
|-------|------------------|-------------------|
| **Stage 1** | Portfolio tracking, KYC/AML, regulatory calendar | Audit engagement tracking, tax filing calendar, working papers, GL integration |
| **Stage 2** | Risk modeling, compliance automation, client churn prediction, advisor benchmarking | Tax optimization AI, audit procedure automation, multi-client portfolio, time & billing |
| **Stage 3** | Regulatory tracking automation, sub-specialty workflows (Islamic, Family Office), AI advisor support | Going concern AI, specialized accounting (nonprofit, government, utility), engagement profitability |

- **Industrial & Infrastructure** (4 distinct sub-groups)
- **Consumer & Commerce** (Retail vs Media)
- **Agriculture & Food** (Single group)
- **Other** (Multi-entity, minimal customization)

## 9. Common Pitfalls & Mitigations

### Pitfall 1: Over-generalization
**Problem:** Building "generic" features that don't resonate with any single industry.  
**Mitigation:** Stage 1 prioritizes hyper-specific workflows. Every feature must serve at least one use case authentically.

### Pitfall 2: Feature Bloat in Stage 1
**Problem:** Trying to ship too much, missing deadline.  
**Mitigation:** Stage 1 = **minimal but complete** workflows. Use Stage 2/3 for enhancement.

### Pitfall 3: Ignoring Sub-Industry Needs
**Problem:** "Accounting" isn't one thing — tax firms, audit firms, bookkeepers have different needs.  
**Mitigation:** Stage 2 introduces sub-industry discriminators. Stage 3 adds hyper-specialization.

### Pitfall 4: Integration Hell
**Problem:** Too many integrations → maintenance nightmare.  
**Mitigation:** Stage 2 = 2-3 critical integrations per industry. Stage 3 = ecosystem expansion.

### Pitfall 5: Compliance Theater
**Problem:** Compliance checklists become boxes to check, not real safety.  
**Mitigation:** Stage 2 integrates compliance into workflows (e.g., "can't approve if HIPAA log empty"). Stage 3 automates compliance.
